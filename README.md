Ohhhhhh  no! The faithful cat of ultimate amazingness has gotten hungry! He will go through many different worlds to eat whatever he can find! He loves to eat watermelons, and baby dragons! Don't poop on them, or else cat will not be able to eat them. That's just...Nasty! Then, like a good kitty, he poops in the toilets c:

 *Instructions:
 
 Using the controls, go through the levels and eat the food provided for the level, baby dragons, watermelons, etc. You can poop once for every two food items cat eats. You must go through the maze to eat the watermelons, and then press the space bar to poop on the toilets. There will be enemies throughout the maze, so you will want to shoot them with your AMAZING CAT EYE LASERS and earn points. (And don't die.) You earn points by pooping in the toilets and you win the level by eating all the food items. 
 
 *Controls:
 Down Arrow = Down
 Up Arrow = Up
 Right Arrow = Right
 Left Arrow = Left
 Ctrl = Shoot Lasers
 Space = Poop
 
(So..Pretty basic controls.. *wink wink*)

 CAN YOU SATISFY THE ULTIMATE CAT'S HUNGER?
